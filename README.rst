Simple Python3 ffmpeg interface for audio and video I/O.
========================================================

Module provides FFmpeg bindings for reading audio/video files and capturing devices in natural Python way.

Module is not supported any more! Now it is more like FFmpeg/SWIG tutorial. Look at [PyAV](https://github.com/mikeboers/PyAV).

By now audio/video reading from file or from device are supported. Code was tested under linux environment.

See examples for details.
